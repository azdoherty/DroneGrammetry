1) compute homography from each image to its K nearest neighbors (compute w/ GPS coords if we have, use RANSAC otherwise)
2) make a matching array of keypoints which match in at least 3 images
3) create an error equation to minimize the difference between different keypoint projections
4) solve that equation
